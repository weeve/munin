This is a repository for any personal Munin plugins I make.  Any information
about them is listed below.

- arris_tm722g-snr:
Plugin to monitor the Signal to Noise rations on an Arris TM722G cable modem.
Supports the config argument.  It's a quick and dirty plugin so it doens't do
things like dynamically get the channel names on the modem or have perldoc 
syntax in it.  Creates the category "arris" in a host view.
